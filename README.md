# Home-Network-Lab

## Objective

This lab aimed to establish a functional small enterprise network by utilizing cisco hardware/firmware in Cisco Packet Tracer. The network devices were configured using the command line to provide OSCP routing functionality across three sites in the enterprise enviornment to allow end-users to communicate to eachother from the sites as well as to the DNS/HTTP servers. This lab was meant to give hands-on configuration experience of Cisco hardware and to troubleshoot various issues that may arise in the network development process. 

### Skills Learned

- Praactical understanding of how a basic enterprise network is configured across sites/subnets
- Proficiency in troubleshooting network communication issues from various endpoints utilizing tracert and ICMP commands
- Ability to understand & implement router/multi-layer switch configurations by utlizing knowlege of port connections and the IP addresses associated
- Enhanced knowledge of routing protocol configuration
- Basic Knowledge of how DHCP, DNS, and HTTP/HTTPS servers are configured to allow end-user functionality
